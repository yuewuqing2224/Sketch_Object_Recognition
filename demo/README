This is a quick demo on how you can use the code.

1. Preprocess image folder contains the demo code for preprocessing input images
   before using them for later recognition. 

2. Bag of word folder contains the demo code for computing bag of word (code book) 
   from local HoG decriptors that we extract from images
   (please note that this step can take a long time depending on the size of input images)

3. Histogram folder contains the demo code for computing the histogram of images
   according to the code book that we get earlier

4. Knn folder contains the demo code for predicting the class label of a new image
   (please note that multiclass svm will generally perform better than knn in this case)

5. Predict folder contains pretrained models on 10 objects and a program that predicts class label
   you can run the program using command line
